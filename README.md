# Javascript

<em>"In September 1995, a Netscape programmer named <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/About_JavaScript#what_javascript_implementations_are_available"><strong>Brendan Eich</strong></a> developed a new scripting language in just 10 days. It was originally named Mocha, but quickly became known as LiveScript and, later, JavaScript. Created out of necessity, <strong>it is used to build 95.2% (1.52 billion)</strong> of websites today, including some of the worldâ€™s largest, like Facebook and YouTube. Without it, we would not have popular and useful web apps such as Google Maps and eBay".</em>

I use this repository to store some short, sometimes funny JS scripts I've developed throughout the Complete 2022 Web Developer Bootcamp, from Udemy.
inside the subfolder 'snippets' you may find some useful scripts I found elsewhere (not developed by me).
